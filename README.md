# myMan

In this repo I store some manual that I wrote to find easly the
information that I presume importat.

For the moment there is a manual on [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/), a [terminal multiplexer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer)  that improves the work, managing more sessions, inside a session, more windows, inside a window more pane.

The other manual is on Managing process on linux.
