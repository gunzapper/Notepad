# my Man

In this repository I store some manual that I wrote to find easily the
information that I presume important.

For the moment there is a manual on [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/), a [terminal multiplexer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer)  that improves the work, managing more sessions, inside a session, more windows, inside a window more pane.

The other manual is on Managing process on Linux.
